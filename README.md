## 🔧 Development

### Code Generation

If using code generation tools:

```bash
# Generate code (for json_serializable, etc.)
flutter packages pub run build_runner build

# Watch for changes and regenerate
flutter packages pub run build_runner watch

# Clean generated files
flutter packages pub run build_runner clean
```

### Localization

To add new languages:

1. Add language codes to `lib/l10n/l10n.dart`
2. Create corresponding `.arb` files in `lib/l10n/`
3. Run: `flutter gen-l10n`

### State Management

This project uses [specify your state management solution]:
